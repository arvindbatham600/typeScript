- Typescript is strongly typed language.
- Strongly typed languages ex - Typescript, Java, C++, Rust
- Benefits of strongly type language:
        1. Lesser runtime error
        2. Stricter codebase
        3. Easy to catch error at compile time.

- People realised that javaScript is a very powerful language, but      lacks types. Typescript was inroduced as a new language to add types on top of javascript.

- Typescript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
- It is a strict syntactical superset of Javascript and adds optional static typing to the language.

- Where/How does typeScript code runs:
    1. Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javaScript.
    2. Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runds in your browser/nodejs runtime)
    3. when Typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking similar to C++. If there is an error, the conversion to javascript fails.

    - Typescript compiler
        1. tsc is the official Typescript compiler.
        2. others - esbuild, swc
