 How can you asign types to objects ? For Example, a user object that  looks like this -

 const user = {
    firstName: "arvind",
    lastName: "batham",
    email: "email.com",
    age: "22"
 }

 to assign the type to the user object, you can use interfaces like
 
 interface User = {
    firstName: string,
    lastName: string,
    email: string,
    age: number
 }

#1 - Create a function isLegal that returns true or false if a user is above 18. It takes a user as an input.
