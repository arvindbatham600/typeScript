- Enums (short for enumerations) in TypeScript are a feature that allows you to define a set of named constants.
- The concept behind an enumeration is to create a human-readable way to represent a set of constant values, which might otherwise be represented as numbers or strings

example - 
Enum Directions{
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
}

- How to change values
enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down, // becomes 2 by default
    Left, // becomes 3
    Right // becomes 4
}

- can also be string

enum Direction {
    Up = "UP",
    Down = "Down",
    Left = "Left",
    Right = 'Right'
}
