- Generics are language independent concepts.

Lets learn by example
    Letâ€™s say you have a function that needs to return the first element of an array. Array can be of type either string or integer

    the solution - 
    const ReturnFirstElement = (arr: (number | string)[]) => {
        return arr[0]
    }
