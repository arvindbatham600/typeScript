types are very similar to interfaces, it lets you aggregate data together.
like 
type User = {
    firstName: string,
    lastName: string,
    age: number
}

- but with types you can do other things too
like 
    1. Union
        type stringOrNumber = string | number
    2. intersection
        type Employee & Manager

        // see Examples.ts file
